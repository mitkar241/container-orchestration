You need to have a Kubernetes cluster, and the kubectl command-line tool must be configured to communicate with your cluster. It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts. If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using `minikube` or you can use one of these Kubernetes playgrounds:

- [ ] [Play with Kubernetes](http://labs.play-with-k8s.com/)

To check the version, enter `kubectl version`.
